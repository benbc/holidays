Simple graph building
     CREATE (:Person {name: "Ben Butler-Cole", age: 44})
     MATCH (me:Person {name: "Ben Butler-Cole"}) RETURN me.age

     Check what towns people are from for duplicates (Derby, Uttoxeter, Burton okay)

     CREATE (:Town {name: "Plymouth"})
     MATCH (t:Town {name: "Plymouth"}) RETURN t

     For people who see more than one result
          MATCH (t:Town {name: "Plymouth"}) DELETE t
          MERGE (:Town {name: "Plymouth"})

     MATCH (t:Town {name: "Plymouth"})
     MATCH (p:Person {name: "Ben Butler-Cole"})
     CREATE (p)-[:LIVES]->(t)

     MATCH (c:Country {name: "United Kingdom"}) return c

     MATCH (t:Town {name: "Plymouth"})
     MATCH (c:Country {name: "United Kingdom"})
     MERGE (t)-[:IN]->(c)

     MATCH (:Person {name: "Ben Butler-Cole"})-[:LIVES]->(t:Town) RETURN t.name
     MATCH (:Person {name: "Ben Butler-Cole"})-[:LIVES]->(:Town)<-[:LIVES]-(p:Person) RETURN p.name
     MATCH (:Country {name: "United Kingdom"})<-[:IN]-(t:Town)<-[:LIVES]-(p:Person) RETURN t.name, p.name ORDER BY t.name
